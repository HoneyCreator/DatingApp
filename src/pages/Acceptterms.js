              These Terms shall be governed by and defined following the laws of

              In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to
              these Terms and Conditions (collectively, "Disputes") between you
              and us, we agree to first attempt to resolve the Dispute

              convening a 4-person panel made up of members of the site,
              including one member of our site staff. If a tiebreaker is
              necessary, the panel shall select an independent third-party
              mediator to assist in the resolution of the Dispute. The Parties
              agree to participate in good faith in the negotiation and
              mediation process fo before initiating any arbitration or filing a
              lawsuit in a court of law. This informal dispute resolution
              process is intended to expedite the resolution of Disputes and
              control the associated costs. If the Parties are unable to resolve
              the Dispute through negotiation or mediation, then either Party
              may initiate arbitration or file a lawsuit in a court of law. The
              Parties agree that any arbitration or legal proceeding shall be
              conducted in accordance with the laws of Panama and that any
              judgment or award shall be binding and enforceable to the fullest
              extent permitted by law.
